    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons yellow curry powder + more for dusting</li>
            <li>1 cup organic ketchup</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
        </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a deep sauce pan heat the vegetable oil over medium heat and saute the diced onion for 4-5 minutes until soft and translucent.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat to medium-low, add the garlic and curry powder, stir and cook for another minute.</li>
            <li>Add the ketchup, stir and cook until it is heated through and gently simmers. Use a splatter guard to minimize mess from the simmering sauce.</li>
            <li>Add the vinegar, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, salt, paprika and mustard. Mix well and cook for a few more minutes until the sauce thickens.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and use an immersion blender to blend all the ingredients. Alternatively transfer to a blender. The curry ketchup should be quite thick. Keep it warm while you cook the bratwurst.</li>
            <li>If the bratwurst in not pre-cooked first simmer it in water, then grill or pan-fry it.</li>
            <li>If grilling, grill until the skin gets crispy on all sides. If pan-frying heat about 1/4 inch deep of oil in a pan and turn the sausage frequently to make sure it gets crispy on all sides.</li>
            <li>Cut in thick bite-sized pieces and serve smothered with curry ketchup and a dusting of curry powder.</li>
        </ol>
