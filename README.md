# odin-recipes
HTML learning project for TheOdinProject!

Introduction:
This will be my first project to showcase what I learned in the foundations
course of The Odin Project so far. I'm excited and a little nervous to use
everything I learned so far.

Project brief:
Build a simple website showcasing 3 different recipes using only HTML. Add
images, headings, and links.
